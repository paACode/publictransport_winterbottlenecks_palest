## Loading the Packages

For this example we use the `nnet` package (and `gamlss.add` to plot these networks) and `ggplot2` to create some plots.

```{r}
library(nnet)
library(gamlss.add)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

And we also need the `caret` package for some helper functions

```{r}
library(caret)
```

## Loading the Data

```{r}
d.zentralbahn <- read.csv("zentrahlbahn_nov_dataset_delay.csv", sep =",", head=TRUE )
```

## A first look at the Data "Ausfälle"

[]

Looks like i the beginning and end of november there are a bit less "Ausfälle".
Also what we can see is that there is a periodic behaviour ( Saturdays and Sundays). Because at weekends there are less traings

```{r}
d.zentralbahn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = BETRIEBSTAG, fill = FAELLT_AUS_TF)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count",position = "dodge")
```

 In this plot we can clearly see that R70 and R71 "Fallen aus" more than they arriv on time. Is probably related to unglück in brienz
```{r}
d.zentralbahn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = LINIEN_TEXT, fill = FAELLT_AUS_TF)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count",position = "dodge")
```
